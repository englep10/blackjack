## Project Workflow
Really great job on user stories and task tracking! I really like your trello board you had for this assignment

## Technical Requirements
Good job on getting your MVP up and running! I see some spots where you could definitely do some refactoring. Maybe abstract some of the declaring a winner functionality and call functions instead of repeating code.

## Creativity
The UI looks decent. I would think about how you might layout this page going forward. Additionally trying to figure out a way to incorporate cards instead of just number values

## Code Quality
I like your comments that clearly say what each function does. I would take it a step further and comment on your conditional logic too. As you comment you might start to see yourself repeating yourself and you can identify good places to refactor. Code indentation looks good and clean

## Problem Solving
You got an MVP. I would take it a step further though. Definitely think about how you might move forward with different logical refactorings and stylistic changes

## Total
Meets Expectations- Nice job on this project Phil. Overall you got a great MVP here and while I think you could definitely improve it definitely proves your abilities with JS/jQuery! Good work.
