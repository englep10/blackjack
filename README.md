# blackjack
My first project for GA, creating a Blackjack game with html/css/js/jquery

I had a great time making this first project. I am very happy with how it turned out. There were mant successes and even more failures.
With that being said some of my success included:
  How I structured my code. What I mean by that is that I have enabled myself to easily go back and improve part of code eaily without breaking the whole thing
  Another success was my hitMe function. I had to use some critical thinking on how to tackle some of the harder parts of how that code should operate. 
  My last success was that I did all this code by myself, without the help of a tutorial or another person. It was really fun to see where my skills have grown and to get a larger sense of how I would tackle a similar problem differently in the future. 

Some Failures:
  I wish I had taken a more object oriented approach.
  I also have a couple bugs in my hitMe funciton with the card values showing up multiple times.
  Finally I would style my application a lot more. 
  
Its a learning process and the next one will always be better than the last.
